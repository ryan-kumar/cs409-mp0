	<p class="bio" id="desc">3rd-year student in Computer Science and Crop Sciences. I am interested in working on embedded systems within the field of agriculture, particularly those involved in sensing and data acquisition. My secondary interest is in Computer Science Education. I am interested in working on developing tools and infrastructure to support education at scale. Additionally, I find the challenge of incorporating, or preventing the usage of LLMs within a given set of coursework to be very intriguing.<br/><br/> 
     I am currently interning at a startup, where I write web-scrapers to scout for new prospective SAS products, and their respective buyers. I am also a lead course assistant for CS 128 here at the University.</p>
